Data Classification Framework
2.1 Data Classification Levels {{name}} uses the following data classification levels to categorize information assets based on their sensitivity and criticality:
a) Public: Information that is intended for public disclosure and has no potential harm to the organization if disclosed, modified, or destroyed. b) Internal: Information intended for internal use within the organization, not intended for public disclosure, and may have limited impact if disclosed, modified, or destroyed. c) Confidential: Information requiring protection from unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction to prevent harm to the organization, employees, customers, or other stakeholders. d) Highly Confidential: Information of the highest sensitivity and criticality, requiring the highest level of protection from unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction.
2.2 Data Classification Responsibilities The responsibilities for data classification within {{name}} are as follows:
a) Management: Ensuring the implementation and enforcement of the data classification policy, providing necessary resources, and assigning data custodians. b) Data Custodians: Assigning appropriate data classifications to information assets, implementing security controls, and overseeing the protection and handling of data within their purview. c) Users: Understanding and applying the data classification policy, adhering to the defined procedures for data handling and protection, and reporting any suspected data classification issues.
2.3 Data Classification Criteria The classification of data should be based on the following criteria:
a) Legal Requirements: Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. b) Sensitivity: The potential impact of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction of the data on the organization, individuals, or stakeholders. c) Criticality: The importance of the data to the organization's operations, continuity, or competitive advantage. d) Confidentiality: The level of confidentiality required to protect the data from unauthorized access or disclosure. e) Integrity: The requirement for data accuracy, completeness, and protection against unauthorized modification. f) Availability: The need for timely access to data to support business operations, services, or customer needs.
Data Handling and Protection
3.1 Data Access and Usage Access to data should be granted on a need-to-know basis, with access controls and user authentication mechanisms in place. Users should only access and use data according to their authorized responsibilities and the defined data classification.
3.2 Data Storage and Retention Data should be stored in appropriate storage locations based on their classification, such as secure servers, databases, or physical containers. The retention of data should follow applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements, as well as defined retention policies.
3.3 Data Transmission and Encryption Data transmission should be protected to ensure confidentiality and integrity. Encryption should be applied to sensitive and highly confidential data when transmitted over public or untrusted networks.
3.4 Data Disposal and Destruction Data should be disposed of securely when no longer needed, following defined data disposal procedures. This includes the secure deletion of electronic data and the proper disposal of physical media to prevent unauthorized access or retrieval.
Data Classification Process
4.1 Data Classification Procedures The data classification process should include the following steps:
a) Data Identification: Identifying information assets and their associated data. b) Data Assessment: Assessing the sensitivity, criticality, and regulatory requirements of the data. c) Data Classification: Assigning the appropriate classification level based on the assessment. d) Data Handling and Protection: Applying the defined security controls and handling procedures according to the data classification.
4.2 Data Classification Training Training programs should be provided to employees to raise awareness of the data classification policy, its importance, and the procedures for data handling and protection. Training should be conducted periodically and whenever significant updates are made to the policy.
4.3 Data Classification Labels Data classification labels should be applied to information assets to clearly indicate their classification level. Labels can be applied to physical documents, electronic files, databases, and other storage media to facilitate proper handling and protection.
Policy Compliance
5.1 Compliance Monitoring Compliance with this data classification policy will be monitored through regular assessments, audits, and reviews of data handling practices, access controls, and security measures. Non-compliance may be identified through monitoring tools, incident reports, or internal/external audits.
5.2 Non-Compliance and Consequences Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contractual relationship, as well as legal consequences.
