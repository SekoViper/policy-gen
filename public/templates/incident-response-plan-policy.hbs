Incident Response Process
3.1 Incident Identification and Reporting Establish mechanisms for identifying and reporting security incidents promptly. This may include incident reporting channels such as a dedicated email address or a hotline. Encourage employees to report incidents they suspect or observe, even if they are unsure.
3.2 Incident Triage and Categorization Upon receiving an incident report, promptly triage and categorize the incident based on its severity, impact, and potential risk to the organization. This step helps determine the appropriate response actions and resource allocation.
3.3 Incident Response Actions Define a set of predefined incident response actions to be followed based on the incident category and severity. These actions may include:
a) Containment: Isolate affected systems or networks to prevent further damage. b) Eradication: Remove the source of the incident, eliminate malware, or mitigate vulnerabilities. c) Recovery: Restore affected systems, data, and services to normal operations. d) Forensic Investigation: Conduct forensic analysis to determine the cause, extent, and impact of the incident. e) Notification: Notify appropriate stakeholders, such as customers, partners, or regulatory authorities, as required.
